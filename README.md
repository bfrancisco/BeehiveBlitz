### **Game Description**
Beehive Blitz is a fast-paced top-down game where two players control bees and compete to gather honey and score points. Developed using Java, this game can currently be played by up to 2 players.

### **Game Mechanics**
The game starts with a simple menu screen, where players can hit the "Start" button to begin.

Each player is assigned a bee: the Orange bee or the Blue bee. The Orange bee starts on the left side of the screen, while the Blue bee starts on the right. The bees are constantly moving in the direction of their head, but players can control their rotation.

As the game progresses, a timer indicator made up of hexagon sprites at the top of the screen updates to show various game events.
- When there are 4 hexagons present, a honey spawns at a random position.
- When there are 5 hexagons present, the bees execute a dashing motion.

The bees can interact with the randomly-spawned honey in two ways: by colliding with the honey sprite to gain 1 point or by colliding their bee's needle with the opponent bee's body to gain 1 point. However, colliding your bee's body with the opponent bee's needle will deduct 1 point from your score. 

The first player to reach 9 points wins the game, so be quick, agile, and strategic in your movements to come out on top!
